# stac_image_collection

Create an image collection from a STAC feature collection



```{r include=FALSE}
library(gdalcubes)
```

## Description

This function creates an image collection from a STAC API collection response. It does not
need to read any image data. Additionally, bands can be filtered and asset links can be transformed to make them
readable for GDAL.


## Usage


```r
stac_image_collection(
  s,
  out_file = tempfile(fileext = ".sqlite"),
  asset_names = NULL,
  asset_regex = NULL,
  url_fun = function(x) {     paste0("/vsicurl/", x) },
  property_filter = NULL,
  skip_image_metadata = FALSE
)

```


## Arguments

| Argument    | Description                       |
|:------------|:----------------------------------|
| s | STAC feature collection |
| out_file | optional name of the output SQLite database file, defaults to a temporary file |
| asset_names | character vector with names of assets (e.g., bands) to be used, other assets will be ignored. By default (NULL), all asset names with "eo:bands" attributes will be used |
| asset_regex | length 1 character defining a regular expression asset names must match to be considered |
| url_fun | optional function to modify URLs of assets, e.g, to add /vsicurl/ to URLS (the default) |
| property_filter | optional function to filter STAC items (images) by their properties; see Details |
| skip_image_metadata | logical, if TRUE per-image metadata (STAC item properties) will not be added to the image collection |


## Details

The property_filter argument can be used to filter images by metadata such as cloud coverage. 
The functions receives all properties of a STAC item (image) as input list and is expected to produce a single logical value,
where an image will be ignored if the function returns FALSE.


## Note

Currently, bbox results are expected to be WGS84 coordinates, even if bbox-crs is given in the STAC response.

This function is experimental.
