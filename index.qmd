gdalcubes is an R package and C++ library aiming at making processing collections of satellite imagery *easier*, *faster*, and *more interactive*.

It provides functions to create and process *four-dimensional regular raster data cubes* from irregular image collections, hiding complexities in the data such as different map projections and spatial overlaps of images, or different spatial resolutions of spectral bands. 

## Features

- Create data cubes from local files or cloud storage
- Process data cubes by applying arithmetic operations on pixels (e.g. to compute vegetation indexes), computing summary statistics over space and time, filtering by space, time, and bands, and applying user-defined R functions on data cubes
- Extract time series or pixels from spatial polygons and points
- Export data cubes as netCDF or GeoTIFF file(s)
- Create training data and apply predictions for machine learning models
- Process data cubes in parallel while reading only smaller (memory-friendly) chunks of a cube at a time

Among others, gdalcubes has been successfully used to process data from the Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5P, Landsat, PlanetScope, MODIS, and Global Precipitation Measurement Earth observation satellites / missions.
