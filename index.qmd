gdalcubes is an R package and C++ library aiming at making processing large collections of satellite imagery *easier*, *faster*, and *more interactive*.

It provides functions to create and process *four-dimensional regular raster data cubes* from irregular image collections, hiding complexities in the data such as different map projections and spatial overlaps of images, or different spatial resolutions of spectral bands. 

## Features

- Create data cubes from local files or cloud storage
- Process data cubes by applying arithmetic operations on pixels (e.g. to compute vegetation indexes), computing summary statistics over space and time filtering by space, time, and  bands, and applying user-defined R functions
- Extract time series or pixels from spatial polygons and points
- Export data cubes as netCDF or GeoTIFF file(s)
- Process data cubes in parallel, reading only small chunks of a cube at a time
- Develop methods efficiently on lower resolution / smaller areas
