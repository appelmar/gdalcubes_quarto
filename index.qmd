gdalcubes is a C++ library and R package aiming at making processing large collections of satellite imagery *easier*, *faster*, and *more interactive*.

It provides functions to create and process *four-dimensional regular raster data cubes* from irregular image collections, hiding 
complexities in the data such as different map projections and spatial overlaps of images, or different spatial resolutions of spatial bands from users.

Built-in functions on data cubes include

- reduction over space and time, 
- filtering by space, time, and  bands,
- arithmetic operations on pixels (e.g. to compute vegetation indexes),
- extraction from polygons, points,
- extraction of time-series and computation of zonal statistics,
- convolutions and moving window aggregation over time,
- gap-filling by time series interpolation,
- combining variables of identically shaped cubes, 
- execution of external processes on data cube chunks (streaming), and 
- export as netCDF or GeoTIFF file(s),

gdalcubes constructs data cubes on the fly, making it straightforward to go from low resolution experiments to full resolution analyses.
